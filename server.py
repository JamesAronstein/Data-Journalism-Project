#should have 3 routes

#one for about

#one for index, which has macro

#and one for the micro, where I can use variables to pass in which micro
    #its just one boro.html pg, that generates something different based on which boro is called with render template
    #use if statement, based on which boro, to load which specific svg


#for nav bar, I should have nav bar.html, and dynamically insert it into each one, so if I make changes in the nav bar, I only change it once

#templates folder would have files for: about.html, index.html, micro.html, graph.svg, map.svg (would prob have one for all 5 boros)
